# Railway Configuration for HireMeBahamas Backend
# This file configures the Python backend service ONLY
# 
# ⚠️ CRITICAL: PostgreSQL Configuration
# ====================================
# DO NOT deploy PostgreSQL as a container service!
# Railway will throw: "root execution of the PostgreSQL server is not permitted"
# 
# ✅ CORRECT Setup:
#    1. In Railway Dashboard → + New → Database → PostgreSQL
#    2. Use Railway's managed PostgreSQL database service
#    3. Railway auto-injects DATABASE_URL environment variable
# 
# ❌ WRONG Setup:
#    - Adding PostgreSQL from container image
#    - Deploying docker-compose.yml files
#    - Installing postgresql server packages
# 
# For detailed instructions, see: RAILWAY_POSTGRES_ROOT_ERROR_FIX.md
