name: Scheduled App Ping

# This workflow keeps the application active by pinging it every 10 minutes.
# Many free-tier hosting platforms (Railway, Render, Heroku, etc.) spin down
# inactive applications after a period of inactivity (typically 15-30 minutes).
#
# Regular pings prevent the app from going to sleep, ensuring:
# - Fast response times for users (no cold start delay)
# - Continuous availability of the service
# - Active database connections (preventing database sleep)
#
# Schedule: Every 10 minutes
# This interval is conservative enough to save GitHub Actions minutes while
# still preventing app sleep on platforms with 15-30 minute inactivity timeouts.
# For database-specific keepalive, see keep-database-awake.yml (runs every 2 minutes).

  schedule:
