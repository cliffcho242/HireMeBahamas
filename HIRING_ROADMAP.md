# SOLO → 1M USERS: Execution-Ready Hiring Plan

This is a real startup hiring plan designed to minimize burn, avoid bad hires, and build a team investors respect while scaling HireMeBahamas from solo founder to 1M+ users.

---

## 🎯 GOAL OF THIS ROADMAP

- **Hire only when leverage is unlocked** – Each hire must remove a critical bottleneck
- **Avoid overstaffing early** – Stay lean and efficient
- **Build a team investors respect** – Quality over quantity
- **Reach 1M users sustainably** – Scale systematically with proper timing

---

## 🧱 PHASE 0 — YOU (NOW → 5K USERS)

### 👑 Your Role (Founder / CTO / PM)

**Current Responsibilities:**
- Architecture design and technical decisions

## 🚨 HIRING RULES (DO NOT BREAK)

### ❌ Never Hire:

1. **"Idea People"** – Everyone must execute, not just strategize
2. **Managers Before Problems** – Don't hire managers until you have >10 people
3. **Full-time Designers Early** – Design needs are bursty; use contracts
4. **DevOps Before Traffic** – Cloud platforms handle this until real scale
5. **Multiple Roles at Once** – Hire one at a time, validate fit
6. **Based on Credentials Alone** – Portfolio and execution > degrees
7. **Friends/Family Without Skill** – Loyalty doesn't ship products

### ✅ Always:

1. **Hire for Leverage** – Each hire should 3X your output, not 1.5X
2. **Hire Slowly** – Take 4-6 weeks to find the right person
3. **Fire Fast If Needed** – 30-day probation, no hesitation if not working
4. **Pay Competitively** – Don't underpay for critical roles
5. **Offer Equity** – Align incentives for long-term success (0.5-2% for early hires)
6. **Set Clear Expectations** – Define success metrics and OKRs
7. **Document Everything** – Systems > heroes; knowledge sharing is critical
