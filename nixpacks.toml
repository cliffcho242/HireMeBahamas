# ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING ABOUT POSTGRESQL:
# -----------------------------------
# We install postgresql-client and libpq-dev for DATABASE CONNECTIVITY ONLY.
# These are CLIENT libraries to CONNECT to Railway's managed PostgreSQL database.

# DO NOT INSTALL: postgresql, postgresql-16, postgresql-server, or any PostgreSQL server packages
# DO NOT DEPLOY: PostgreSQL as a container on Railway
# 
# Railway provides managed PostgreSQL databases. See RAILWAY_SETUP_REQUIRED.md for setup instructions.
# If you see "root execution of the PostgreSQL server is not permitted" error,
# you have misconfigured Railway. Read RAILWAY_SETUP_REQUIRED.md immediately.
