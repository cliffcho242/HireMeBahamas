# 🎉 User Profile Enhancement - COMPLETE

## What Was Done

✅ **Frontend** - Updated 7 files to show @username and occupation everywhere
✅ **Backend** - Added 3 new database columns (username, occupation, company_name)
✅ **Migration** - Database updated successfully
✅ **API** - Schemas updated to support new fields

## How It Works

Every user profile now shows:
1. **Full Name** (first + last name)
2. **@username** (in blue) - unique handle for the user
3. **Occupation** or **Company Name** (in gray) - what they do

Example:
```
John Smith
@johnsmith
Licensed Plumber
```

## Where It Appears

- ✅ Home page sidebar (your profile card)
- ✅ Navigation bar dropdown
- ✅ Mobile navigation menu
- ✅ Post creation modal
- ✅ All posts in the feed
- ✅ Profile page (view and edit)

## How to Test

1. **Open the app** - Frontend should be running on http://localhost:3000
2. **Go to your Profile** - Click your name/avatar
3. **Click "Edit Profile"**
4. **Fill in the new fields:**
   - Username (e.g., "johnsmith") - will show as "@johnsmith"
   - Occupation (e.g., "Plumber", "Electrician", "Chef")
   - Company Name (e.g., "ABC Plumbing" - optional)
5. **Save** - Your new info appears everywhere!

## Backend Status

✅ Server running on http://127.0.0.1:8008
✅ Health check: http://127.0.0.1:8008/health
✅ Database has new columns
✅ API ready to save and load new fields

## Notes

- All fields are **optional** - you don't have to fill them
- If you don't set a username, it uses your email address
- If you don't set occupation, it shows your user type (Employer/Job Seeker)
- The username must be unique (no two users can have the same @username)

## Done! 🎊

The feature is fully implemented and ready to use. Just test it in the browser!
