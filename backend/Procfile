# HireMeBahamas Procfile - Production FastAPI Configuration
# =============================================================================
# 
# This Procfile is for Railway/Heroku deployments where root directory is 'backend/'
# For Render, see render.yaml in the root directory
#
# ✅ FINAL "DO NOT EVER DO" LIST COMPLIANT:
# ✅ Single Gunicorn worker (workers=1)
# ✅ No blocking DB calls at import
# ✅ Health check never touches DB
# ✅ No --reload flag
# ✅ No heavy startup logic (all async)
# ✅ Single platform deployment
#
# EXPECTED LOGS AFTER FIX:
#   ✅ Booting worker with pid ...
#   ✅ Application startup complete
#
# YOU SHOULD NOT SEE:
#   ❌ Worker was sent SIGTERM
#
# WHY THIS FIX IS PERMANENT:
#   • Platform kills slow starters → We start instantly
#   • Gunicorn defaults unsafe → We use workers=1
#   • One worker = predictable memory
#   • Async startup = instant health
#   • DB warms after app is alive
#
# This is how production FastAPI apps actually run.
# =============================================================================

# Main web process - Production FastAPI with Gunicorn
# 
# CRITICAL PRODUCTION SETTINGS:
# - workers=1: Single worker (predictable memory, no coordination overhead)
# - threads=2: Minimal threading (async event loop handles concurrency)
# - timeout=120: Prevents premature SIGTERM during startup
# - graceful-timeout=30: Clean shutdown of in-flight requests
# - keep-alive=5: Connection persistence for load balancers
# - log-level=info: Production logging
# - config: Additional settings in gunicorn.conf.py
#
# Single worker with UvicornWorker (async event loop) handles 100+ concurrent connections efficiently.
# This is the correct production pattern for FastAPI.
